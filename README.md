# Portfolio Website

I decided to create this website in my favorite style, flat design, as I enjoy flat illustrations and plan to create my own and incorporate them into my site in the future. As a result, the website needed to have a comparable stylistic approach. I chose the following main colors: blue, which signifies confidence; purple, representing creativity; orange and yellow, symbolizing positivity. Orange and yellow were key because they matched the style of the main elements of the site - lightbulbs - and embodied the concept of a bright idea. I kept a font from the Bootstrap library, as it seemed suitable for the site's style and my initial vision.

## Challenges Faced

The process of creating a portfolio site was challenging for me for three reasons:

1. **Lack of portfolio content:** I determined that I would develop in the direction of web development and illustration. In my view, a portfolio site should be created when there are at least four pieces of work that one is not ashamed to display. For web development, I had one site from midterm and one page from the previous semester, which seemed insufficiently substantial. In terms of illustrations, I only had two that I wasn't entirely satisfied with, and I didn't want to include them in my site just for the sake of content. Therefore, I found a compromise by adding my own photographs and using them to practice building grids with Bootstrap. I've decided that this website will be improved and updated in the future, with sections added to showcase works that I'm proud of.

2. **Tight timeline:** Even though there were three weeks allocated for working on the website, this seemed sufficient only if we exclude assignments from other subjects. Thus, I had about 5-6 full days for working on the website, with the final day reserved for error checking and site testing. Understanding the time constraints, I made the site as simple as possible to avoid complications during layout.

3. **Lack of knowledge and experience:** I don't like boring websites, and I wanted mine to be highly interactive. However, many interactive ideas require JavaScript knowledge, and I was limited to CSS. For instance, I wanted each lightbulb on the homepage to change color or size when clicked, but I realized that using extensive SVG code for each image and then applying animation codes would be too complex and time-consuming. Additionally, I wanted clicking each lightbulb to change the background color of the page, but I didn't understand how to implement this dependency in CSS. Therefore, I had to simplify many aspects based on my current skill level.

## Additional Details

Furthermore, during the website development process, I used the library [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) to add animations.

To create the banner image, I based it on several prototype icons featuring lightbulbs from the website [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/ru/18-lamp-and-light-icons-DYNGX3). I have a license for these materials, so in this case, I did not infringe on copyright.

I hand-drew the images for the Services section while referencing examples online and exported them into SVG files.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I learned to use the Bootstrap library while creating the site. It made many processes easier and faster, particularly when it came to handling different screen sizes, which had always posed difficulties for me. Overall, I consider developing my own website to be an incredibly interesting task that allows for better self-understanding and a clearer sense of priorities in web design.
